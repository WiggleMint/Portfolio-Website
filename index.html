            <h1>Me, Myself & I</h1>
            <p>
                I am a student at University of Bath, currently studying Accounting and Finance, and I’ve done a work placement at YM&U Business Management Ltd as a Tax Intern. 
                However, while I had a great experience working for the company, I realised that the position didn’t excite me in any way. 
                I’ve realised that I am much more passionate about technology and software development and have decided that I’m interested in pursuing these passions on a professional level.
            </p>
            <p>
                Software development wasn’t my initial career path, but I’m glad I discovered it. 
                I’m passionate about software development because designing computer programs lets me use my analytical and problem-solving skills to create things that will be used by others. 
                I’ve been learning HTML, CSS, and JavaScript via online resources, such as Udemy and W3Schools and have learned the fundamentals of programmings, such as how to use if statements, while and for loops, and how to create functions.
            </p>
            <p>
                I’m interested in all manners of software development, but I’m currently focused on learning web development. 
                Considering that most electronic devices today have a web browser; web development would allow for me to create applications that can reach the most people. 
                It also allows me to apply the general programming fundamentals that I learn sooner.
                I've been learning web deveolpment since February of this year.
            </p>
            <p>
                I’ve always been the person in my family and friends group that they would go to whenever they had computer or phone related problems. 
                As such, I have also been interested in the IT sector, as I feel that I would be good at helping clients with both hardware and software computer related problems.
            </p>
            <p>
                I am a hardworking, motivated individual with an attention to detail and a passion for learning new skills.
