            <h1>Me, Myself & I</h1>
            <p>
                I am a student at University of Bath, currently studying Accounting and Finance. I've done a placement as a Tax Intern at YM&U Business Management Ltd and I'm interested in pursuing a career in Accounting and Finance, particularly in the Tax sector.
                
            </p>
            <p>However during my final year of university, I discovered a passion for software development that I'm also interested in pursuing on a professional level.</p>
            <p>
                I am interested in learning many aspects of software development but I am currently focused on learning web development. 
                Most people today use at least one device with access to a web browser, so I figured that web development would allow me to create websites and applications that can reach the most people.
                I've have been on my software development journey since January of 2023.
            </p>
            <p>
                I am a hardworking, motivated individual with an attention to detail and a passion for learning new skills.
